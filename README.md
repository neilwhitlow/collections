# collections
Generic collections with nuances not found in the standard library.

I need this functionality for other projects, and while I'm sure there are numerous alternatives, the purpose here was also for me to learn about Go API design, packaging, etc.

I've stuck to implementing only those features I need to support other features or wanted to learn how to do from scratch, so I guarantee you there are more robust implemntations of some of these data structures out there.
